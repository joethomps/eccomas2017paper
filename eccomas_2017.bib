  Abstract                 = {This paper considers cascaded, lumped, flexible systems, which may be short and non-uniform, which are driven by an arbitrarily moving boundary. Such systems exhibit vaguely wave-like behaviour yet defy classical wave analysis. The paper proposes novel ways to analyse and model such systems in terms of waves. It presents two new wave models for non-uniform systems, one series and one shunt, defining their component wave transfer functions, and thereby providing a way to define, identify and measure component waves. Features of the models are compared. The series and shunt configurations are mutually consistent and can be combined into a single composite wave model. The models are exact, but elements within them remain arbitrary to some degree, implying slight differences in the wave decomposition of the system. Some good model choices are proposed and explored. Wave speed and wave impedance are briefly considered, as are ways to measure component waves. Implications are discussed. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of controlling the position and vibration of open-chain$\backslash$nflexible structures undergoing fast maneuvers is of wide interest. In$\backslash$nthis work, the general flexible structure is actuated by a single$\backslash$nactuator at one end, which, depending on the case of interest, is$\backslash$ncapable of rotating, translating, or simultaneously translating and$\backslash$nrotating the root of the flexible system. The goal is to control the$\backslash$nmotion of the entire flexible system from rest to rest. This needs a$\backslash$nsimultaneous synthesis of position control and active vibration damping.$\backslash$nA new strategy is presented based on further developments of wave-based$\backslash$ncontrol. As before it views the actuator motion as simultaneously$\backslash$nlaunching and absorbing mechanical waves into and out of the system. But$\backslash$na new simple method of resolving the actuator motion into two waves is$\backslash$npresented. By measuring the elastic forces exchanged at the interface$\backslash$nbetween the actuator and the rest of the system, a returning$\backslash$ndisplacement wave can be resolved. This is then added to a set, launch$\backslash$nwave to determine the actuator motion. Typically the launch wave is set$\backslash$nto reach half the target displacement, and the addition of the return$\backslash$nwave absorbs the vibration while simultaneously moving the system the$\backslash$nsecond half of the target displacement, neatly achieving the two goals$\backslash$nin one controlled motion. To date wave-based control has been applied to$\backslash$nlumped, second-order, longitudinally vibrating systems. The refined$\backslash$nmethod avoids a difficulty that previously arose in some contexts,$\backslash$nthereby making wave-based control even more generic. It can easily$\backslash$ncontrol nonlinear elastic systems, laterally bending systems (in the$\backslash$nsense of Euler-Bernoulli beams), and slewing systems where lateral$\backslash$ntranslation and system rotation are strongly coupled. Numerical$\backslash$nsimulation results are presented for controlled, rest-to-rest maneuvers$\backslash$nof representative flexible structures, all controlled using the same$\backslash$n(linear) algorithm. The first case is control of a string of rigid$\backslash$nbodies interconnected by nonlinear springs. The second problem is the$\backslash$nrotational control of a very flexible one-link planar manipulator.$\backslash$nFinally, in an extension of the previous system, the actuator both$\backslash$ntranslates and rotates, slewing the flexible system to a target lateral$\backslash$ndisplacement and a target rotation angle simultaneously. The strategy is$\backslash$nfound to be remarkably effective with many advantages. It seamlessly$\backslash$nintegrates position and vibration control. It is rapid, robust, energy$\backslash$nefficient, and computationally light. It requires little sensing, little$\backslash$nknowledge of the flexible system dynamics, and copes well with nonideal$\backslash$nactuator behavior. It is generic and easily handles a wide variety of$\backslash$nflexible systems. It can get the entire system to stop dead exactly at$\backslash$ntarget with little vibration in transit.},
